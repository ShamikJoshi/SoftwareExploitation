# SoftwareExploitation
Project made on developing and cracking the software.

In this project, first the program is developed and then attempts are made to break or crack the program.                          
If the program is cracked, then the feedback is given about how to secure the program.                                             
And again attempts are made to break the updated program.                                                                          

This whole process is documented and the codes and commands are given in adjacent files.                                           

Various open source tools are used to crack the program.
